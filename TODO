implement better batching
implement scaling matrix support
figure out how to have better game objects.



Main features:
* Environment mapping.(then water reflection. )
* deferred shading.
* SSAO
* particle system.
* geo clipmapping
http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/sample-code/terrain-rendering-with-geometry-clipmaps/

* some kind of spartial data structure, potentially.
* shadows.
* road rendering.

tree
torch.
traffic sign.

* target polygon count:
10000 is way too many.
3000 can be fine depending on the model. if it is a complex model.

also, texture sizes should be 256x256 to 512x512

fire particle effect out pipe at back.
particle effect at goal to mark the goal.
use railings to make sure car is in track.
sparkles fly when you land?

using four framebuffers:

fbo1: normal.x normal.y normal.z empty
fbo2: diffuse.r diffuse.g diffuse.b empty
fbo3: specular.r specular.g specular.b shininess
depth buffer: depth
with 16-bits float for each channel.

* Make better unit testing framework.
* make program for converting shader to png texture.
* make better clouds. See here for inspiration: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XlSSRd
* implement precomputed radiance transfer for prebaked global illuminatin

to handle materials with multiple brdfs, store material id in buffer.


We don't need to store the position in a texture:

"The position is usually not stored. It is instead reconstituted in
the second pass by math that's too complex to get into here. Suffice
it to say, we use the depth buffer and the screen-space fragment
position as the input to figure out the camera-space position of the
point on a surface."

we want to render to four render targets. in total, we get 16 floating
point numbers to play around with!
