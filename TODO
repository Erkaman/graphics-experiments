* target polygon count:
10000 is way too many.
3000 can be fine depending on the model. if it is a complex model.

also, texture sizes should be 256x256 to 512x512

fire particle effect out pipe at back.
particle effect at goal to mark the goal.
use railings to make sure car is in track.
sparkles fly when you land?

to handle materials with multiple brdfs, store material id in buffer.


We don't need to store the position in a texture:

"The position is usually not stored. It is instead reconstituted in
the second pass by math that's too complex to get into here. Suffice
it to say, we use the depth buffer and the screen-space fragment
position as the input to figure out the camera-space position of the
point on a surface."

we want to render to four render targets. in total, we get 16 floating
point numbers to play around with!
