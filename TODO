animated perlin:

This was produced by viewing a slice of 3D noise. For animation, the viewing area moves in two dimensions (z and y). One dimension makes the fire flicker, the other makes it look like it's rising. A simple gradient was applied to the resulting noise to fade away towards the top.

has a very clean implementation of 3d noise: use this base!

also use
noise1234.c as base


GUI design.
