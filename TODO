The format will need the following:

map_Bump normal.png
map_Kd diffuse.png
map_spec specular.png
map_height height.png

matColorSpecular, the specular color, will be used as specular if no
specular texture is specified

materialShininess, is ammlunt of shininess for material. should always
be specified.


* bump mapping.
* http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2006/SIGGRAPH06_Course_ShadingInValvesSourceEngine.pdf
* read about ambient cube.

misc todo:
* implement precomputed radiance transfer for prebaked global illuminatin
* shadow mapping.
* create an efficient terrain system.
* water rendering
* shadows.
* make prettier text.


* detail textures to improve the grass texture. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2008/11/03/detail-textures.aspx

* trees.


* HDR
* make bmp loader.

animated perlin:

This was produced by viewing a slice of 3D noise. For animation, the viewing area moves in two dimensions (z and y). One dimension makes the fire flicker, the other makes it look like it's rising. A simple gradient was applied to the resulting noise to fade away towards the top.

has a very clean implementation of 3d noise: use this base!

also use
noise1234.c as base


GUI design.
